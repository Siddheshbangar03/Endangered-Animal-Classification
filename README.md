# Endangered-Animal-Classification

Endangered Animal Classification with 15 animals.

In a world where biodiversity is threatened, I embarked on a mission to contribute to wildlife conservation through cutting-edge technology. I proudly present my project on Endangered Animal Classification, employing state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
Objective:
The primary goal of this project was to develop a robust and accurate classification system capable of identifying and categorizing endangered animals from a diverse dataset.

The CNN model exhibited impressive accuracy in classifying endangered animals, providing a valuable tool for researchers, conservationists, and wildlife enthusiasts.
